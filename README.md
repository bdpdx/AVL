AVL
===

C++ template implementation of AVL tree with no recursion in either insert or delete.

The included project is an Xcode project but there's no requirement that this run on a Mac.  Xcode is just convenient for me.

I may add some additional unit tests but things seem to be working so far.

I wrote this to refresh my memory on AVL trees and because I've always wanted to implement one that didn't use recursion for insert.  Traversal still recurses.
